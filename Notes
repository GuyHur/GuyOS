Magic number for the bootloader - 0x1badb002

print - 
for me to print the text to the screen i need to start at memory location 0x68000, each word
contains 2 bytes which the first one contains the color of the text and the second byte contains the actual char


To boot into the OS:

make install

sudo vim /boot/grub/grub.cfg
write:

### BEGIN GUYKERNEL ###
menuentry 'Guy's Operating System'{
    multiboot /boot/mykernel.bin
    boot
}
###END GUYKERNEL ###




to run:
make run
